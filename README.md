I have completed my undergraduate thesis in Machine Learning & Deep Learning under Subir Saha, Assistant Professor, Dept of CSE, PUST. My thesis topic is Fake news detection using 
machine learning and deep learning Approaches. In this study, we combined CNN and LSTM to create a novel model that we used to detect fake news with accurately. In the same time, I have 
used many machine learning algorithms in an attempt to determine which algorithm would work best for the dataset using comparing and displaying the results. Span: March, 2023â€“January, 2024.
